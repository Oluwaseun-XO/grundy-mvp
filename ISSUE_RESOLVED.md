# âœ… Issue Resolved: Blank Page Fixed

## Problem Summary
You were experiencing a blank page when clicking "Proceed to Checkout" in your local development environment.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by your local code being out of sync with the latest GitHub repository updates. Specifically, you were missing:

1. **New webhook implementation** (`/api/paystack/webhook`)
2. **Updated payment flow** that creates orders before payment initialization
3. **New Firebase utility functions** (`updateOrderPaymentStatus`)
4. **Fixed TypeScript errors** and import statements

## Solution Applied
I've successfully:

âœ… **Fixed all TypeScript errors** in the codebase
âœ… **Updated payment flow** to create orders first, then process payments
âœ… **Added comprehensive webhook system** for production reliability
âœ… **Removed unused imports and variables**
âœ… **Verified build passes successfully**
âœ… **Tested checkout flow** - no more blank page!
âœ… **Pushed all fixes to GitHub**

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Update Your Local Code
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/your/grundy-mvp

# Pull the latest changes
git pull origin main

# Restart your development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Fix
1. Open http://localhost:3000/customer
2. Add items to cart
3. Click "Proceed to Checkout"
4. âœ… You should now see the checkout form instead of a blank page!

## Current Status

## Next Steps

2. **Test all features** to ensure everything works
3. **Deploy to Vercel** when ready
4. **Add your Paystack keys** to production environment
